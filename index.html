        <p>
          The next day was heavy. With 30 hours to post time I had no press credentials and ‚Äî according to the sports
          editor of the Louisville Courier-Journal ‚Äî no hope at all of getting any. Worse, I needed two sets; one for
          myself and another for Ralph Steadman, the English illustrator who was coming from London to do some Derby
          drawings. All I knew about him was that this was his first visit to the United States. And the more I pondered
          that fact, the more it gave me fear. Would he bear up under the heinous culture shock of being lifted out of
          London and plunged into a drunken mob scene at the Kentucky Derby? There was no way of knowing. Hopefully, he
          would arrive at least a day or so ahead, and give himself time to get acclimated. Maybe a few hours of
          peaceful sightseeing in the Bluegrass country around Lexington. My plan was to pick him up at the airport in
          the huge Pontiac Ballbuster I'd rented from a used car salesman named Colonel Quick, then whisk him off to
          some peaceful setting to remind him of England.


        </p>

          Colonel Quick had solved the car problem, and money (four times the normal rate) had bought two rooms in a
          scumbox on the outskirts of town. The only other kink was the task of convincing the moguls at Churchill Downs
          that Scanlans was such a prestigious sporting journal that common sense compelled them to give us two sets of
          the best press tickets. This was not easily done. My first call to the publicity office resulted in total
          failure. The press handler was shocked at the idea that anyone would be stupid enough to apply for press
          credentials two days before the Derby. ‚ÄúHell, you can't be serious,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe deadline was two months
          ago. The press box is full; there's no more room ‚Ä¶ and what the hell is Scanlan's Monthly anyway?‚Äù
